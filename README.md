> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that creates a new branch after assigning an issue

Built in response to this feature reuest issue:
https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1125

## What does this app do?

The typical workflow is:
 1. An issue is created, for example: Issue 15: Fix nasty bug!

 *some time may pass*

 2. The issue is assigned
 3. When the issue is assigned this app will create a new issue branch
    (for the example issue this branch will be called `issue-15-Fix_nasty_bug`)

If the issue is re-assigned no new branch will be created.


## Configuration

Branch names are generated from the issue, there are 3 flavours:

 1. `tiny` => an `i` followed by the issue number, for example: `i15`
 2. `short` => the word `issue` followed by the issue number, for example:
    `issue-15`
 3. `full` => the word issue followed by the issue number followed by the
    issue title, for example: `issue-15-Fix_nasty_bug`
    
The default is `full`, other types can be configured by placing a YAML file in your repository at the location: `.github/issue-branch.yml` with the content:

```
branchName: tiny
```

or

```
branchName: short
```
