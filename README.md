A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that creates a new branch after assigning an issue

Built in response to this feature reuest issue: https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1125

# Installation

You can install the app directly from [*this page*](https://github.com/apps/create-issue-branch)

# Usage

The typical workflow is:
 1. An issue is created, for example: Issue 15: Fix nasty bug!

 *some time may pass*

 2. The issue is assigned
 3. When the issue is assigned this app will create a new issue branch
    (for the example issue this branch will be called `issue-15-Fix_nasty_bug`)

If the issue is re-assigned no new branch will be created.

# Configuration

This app does not require a configuration. However, if you want to override 
the default behaviour you can do so by placing a YAML file in your repository 
at the location: `.github/issue-branch.yml` with the overrides.

### Branch names

Branch names are generated from the issue, there are 3 flavours:

 1. `tiny` => an `i` followed by the issue number, for example: `i15`
 2. `short` => the word `issue` followed by the issue number, for example:
    `issue-15`
 3. `full` => the word issue followed by the issue number followed by the
    issue title, for example: `issue-15-Fix_nasty_bug`
    
The default is `full`, other types can be configured in the YAML like this:

```yaml
branchName: tiny
```

or

```yaml
branchName: short
```

## Source branch based on issue label

You can override the source branch (by default the "default branch" of the
repository is used) based on the issue label.

For example, if you want branches for issues with the `enhancement` label to
have the `dev` branch as a source and branches for issues with the `bug`
label to have the `staging` branch as a source, add this to your configuration
YAML:

```yaml
branches:
  - label: enhancement
    name: dev
  - label: bug
    name: staging
```

When issues have multiple labels the branch of the first match (based on the 
order in the configuration YAML will be used).

If a configured branch does not exist in the repository the "default branch"
is used.

## Branch name prefix based on issue label

Branch names can be prefixed based on the label of an issue.

For example, if you want branches for issues with the `enhancement` label to
have the `feature/` prefix and branches for issues with the `bug` label to 
have the `bugfix/` prefix, add this to your configuration YAML:

```yaml
branches:
  - label: enhancement
    prefix: feature/
  - label: bug
    prefix: bugfix/
```

You can use `${...}` placeholders in the prefix to substitute fields from the
GitHub issue assignment JSON object. For example, if you want the GitHub login name of the user that created
the issue in the branch prefix, add this to your configuration YAML:

```yaml
branches:
  - label: enhancement
    prefix: feature/${issue.user.login}/
```

Check 
[test/fixtures/issues.assigned.json](test/fixtures/issues.assigned.json) for
all possible placeholder names.

## Matching labels with wildcards

Wildcard characters '?' (matches any single character) and '*' (matches any sequence of characters, 
including the empty sequence) can be used in the label field.

For example, to set the default/fallback prefix `issues/` for issues that do not have the `enhancement`  or `bug`
label, use this configuration:

```yaml
branches:
  - label: enhancement
    prefix: feature/
  - label: bug
    prefix: bugfix/
  - label: '*'
    prefix: issues/
```

*Remember to put quotes around a single asterisk ('\*') in YAML*
